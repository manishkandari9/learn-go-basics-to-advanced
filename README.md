# 🟦 Day 1 – What is Go?

Go (also called Golang) is an open-source programming language created at Google in 2007 and released publicly in 2009.  
It focuses on **simplicity**, **speed**, and **high performance**, especially for modern cloud-native applications.

---

## ⭐ Why Go Was Created  
Go was designed to solve three major problems developers faced:

1. **Slow Compilation** in languages like C++  
2. **Complex Codebases** with too many concepts  
3. **Poor Concurrency Support** in older languages  

Go provides:
- Fast compilation  
- Simple and readable syntax  
- Built-in concurrency with goroutines  
- Easy deployment with single binary builds  

---

## 🟨 Key Features of Go
- **Simple Syntax** (only 25 keywords)
- **Fast Execution** (comparable to C/C++)
- **Memory Efficient**
- **Built-in Concurrency** (`goroutines`)
- **Great for scalable apps**
- **Cross-platform builds**

---

## 🟩 Where is Go Used?
Some of the world’s biggest tools are written in Go:

- **Docker**
- **Kubernetes**
- **Grafana**
- **Terraform**
- **Cloudflare**
- **Uber backend**

Go is the first choice for **DevOps**, **cloud**, **microservices**, **backend**, and **distributed systems**.

---

## 🟪 Example: A Simple “Hello World”
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Go!")
}
```
